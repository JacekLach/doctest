# doctest

A reimplementation of pythons doctest for clojure.

## Usage

Eventually it will parse test cases out of your docstrings and text files.
It'll never be as easy as pythons, due to lack of raw / triple-quoted strings -
so if your code works on strings, you'll have to backslash every quote :(
